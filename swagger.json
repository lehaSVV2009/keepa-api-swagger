                        "description": "A two-dimensional history array containing the product’s historical data. Access the first dimension index using the following enum/constants: \n\n0 - AMAZON, \n\n1 - NEW, \n\n2 - USED, \n\n3 - SALES, \n\n4 - LISTPRICE, \n\n5 - COLLECTIBLE, \n\n6 - REFURBISHED, \n\n7 - NEW_FBM_SHIPPING, \n\n8 - LIGHTNING_DEAL, \n\n9 - WAREHOUSE, \n\n10 - NEW_FBA, \n\n11 - COUNT_NEW, \n\n12 - COUNT_USED, \n\n13 - COUNT_REFURBISHED, \n\n14 - COUNT_COLLECTIBLE, \n\n15 - EXTRA_INFO_UPDATES, \n\n16 - RATING, \n\n17 - COUNT_REVIEWS, \n\n18 - BUY_BOX_SHIPPING, \n\n19 - USED_NEW_SHIPPING, \n\n20 - USED_VERY_GOOD_SHIPPING, \n\n21 - USED_GOOD_SHIPPING, \n\n22 - USED_ACCEPTABLE_SHIPPING, \n\n23 - COLLECTIBLE_NEW_SHIPPING, \n\n24 - COLLECTIBLE_VERY_GOOD_SHIPPING, \n\n25 - COLLECTIBLE_GOOD_SHIPPING, \n\n26 - COLLECTIBLE_ACCEPTABLE_SHIPPING, \n\n27 - REFURBISHED_SHIPPING, \n\n28 - EBAY_NEW_SHIPPING, \n\n29 - EBAY_USED_SHIPPING, \n\n30 - TRADE_IN, \n\n31 - RENTAL, \n\n32 - BUY_BOX_USED_SHIPPING, \n\n33 - PRIME_EXCL. \n\nThe second dimension contains the price/value history in the format `Keepa time minutes, value, […]` or, if the type includes `*_SHIPPING` costs, the format: `Keepa time minutes, price, shipping costs, […]`. If history is unavailable, it is `null`. The price is an integer of the respective Amazon locale’s smallest currency unit (e.g., euro cents or yen). If no offer was available in the given interval (e.g., out of stock), the price has the value -1. \n\nImportant csv information: \n\nKeepa only append a new entry to the history array if the price/value changed, not every time Keepa update the product. \n\nShipping and Handling costs are not included unless specified. \n\nAmazon is considered to be part of the marketplace. If Amazon has the overall lowest new price, the marketplace new price in the corresponding time interval is identical to the Amazon price. \n\nThe following types are only set if the offers parameter was used in the Product Request: NEW_FBM_SHIPPING, WAREHOUSE, NEW_FBA, RATING, COUNT_REVIEWS, BUY_BOX_SHIPPING, USED_SHIPPING, COLLECTIBLE_SHIPPING, REFURBISHED_SHIPPING, BUY_BOX_USED_SHIPPING, and PRIME_EXCL \n\nAbout Lightning deals: If a deal is currently active, the last entry of the history array will contain the end date (a future date) with a price of -1. When accessing the current deal price, handle this special case. Alternatively, use the current price array of the stats object to access the current price. If no deal is currently active but the last entry has the value -1 with a date in the future, it means an upcoming deal is announced (scheduled to start at that date). \n\nAbout eBay prices: eBay listings often have incorrect information and/or product codes, causing item mismatches and incorrect pricing information. Use eBay price history information with caution and do not rely on their accuracy. Keepa update eBay prices at different intervals than Amazon prices. \n\nKeepa can add new data types to the csv field from time to time without announcement. Do not expect a fixed size of the first array dimension in your implementation."
